# SQL-DATA-CLEANING-PROJECT
ðŸ§¹ SQL Data Cleaning: Layoffs Dataset This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a real-world dataset containing information about company layoffs. Using SQL, I performed a series of data wrangling steps to ensure accuracy, consistency, and usability for further analysis or visualization.


# ðŸ“¦  Dataset Overview
The dataset includes the following variables:
* company: Name of the company
* location: Specific city or region
* industry: Industry sector of the company
* total_laid_off: Number of employees laid off
* percentage_laid_off: Proportion of workforce laid off
* date: Date of the layoff
* stage: Company funding stage (e.g., Series A, Series B)
* country: Country of operation
* funds_raised_per_millions: Total funds raised by the company in millions

# ðŸ§½ Data Cleaning Tasks

* Removed duplicate records
* Cleanded text casing and removed extra white spaces
* Standardized inconsistent industry names (e.g., "crypto, cryptocurrency." to "crypto")
* standardized date formats
* Handled missing values and NULLs
* Created new columns for better time-based analysis

  
# ðŸ”§ Tools Used
* MySQL for data querying and transformation
* Cleaned SQL scripts available for reproducibility
* Well-documented workflow with comments in each query
